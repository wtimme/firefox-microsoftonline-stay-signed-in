# Microsoft Online: Stay signed in

A Firefox add-on to skip the pesky "Stay signed in?" page in Microsoft Online's login flow.

When logging in to Microsoft Online (e.g. in order to access your work email inbox),
depending on the configuration, you need to go through a few steps (e.g. entering username/password, OTP).
At the very end of this flow, you are asked whether you wanted to stay signed in.
For me, at least, this is _always_ the case, and having to confirm this every time that I am logging in
quickly gets tiresome.

This addon automatically ticks the "Don't show this again" checkbox and clicks "Yes" for you,
making sure that you only see the screen for a brief moment and, most importantly, that you
do not need to interact with it at all.

## How to test the addon

After cloning the repository, you can use the `test-page.html` file for testing the add-on.
The page contains easy-to-follow steps on how to debug the redirects.

To confirm that it is working with the actual (live) flow, do the following:

1. From your checkout, run `web-ext run`. This opens a new Firefox window with the add-on installed.
2. In that new window, visit https://outlook.office.com/mail

## How to package the addon

1. Install `web-ext` (see [their GitHub README][web-ext])
2. From your checkout, run the build script: `./build.sh`
